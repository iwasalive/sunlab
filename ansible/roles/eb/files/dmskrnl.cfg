;
; Limited permission is hereby granted to reproduce and modify this

; in its entirety in any such reproduction or modification.
;
;
; This configuration file follows standard .ini file syntax with some minor extensions.
;
; A note about changing values in this file while the server is running:
;
; Most values will be re-read dynamically when this file is saved, and the server will
; use the new values without requiring a restart.
;
; The following exceptions apply (server restart required):
;  - Broadcast/Listener port and address bindings
;  - SSL configuration
;  - cluster name/address settings
;  - FileServices settings (point cloud and raster streaming)
;
; Access Control Lists:
;
;   An Access Control List (ACL) may be applied to some entries, so that the configuration
;   information may be selectively supplied to clients based on the client's address or subnet.
;
;   Generally speaking, ACLs are not designed to support filtering of specific addresses
;   (e.g., allow specific address 1.2.3.4, but deny specific address 5.6.7.8). They are
;   more intended to provide selective visibility of configuration data based on specific
;   exclusions to generic rules.
;
;   ACL entries are of the format: [ORDER(x,y),ALLOW(mask1,maskN...),DENY(mask1,maskN...)].
;
;   The actual ordering of the ORDER, ALLOW, and DENY keywords is not important. The keywords
;   are not case sensitive, except that mixed-case is not permitted ("allow" and "ALLOW" are
;   acceptable, but not "Allow").
;
;   A description of each element of the ACL follows:
;
;   ORDER:
;
;       The ORDER tag dictates in which order the ALLOW and DENY statements are evaluated.
;       A ORDER(ALLOW,DENY) tag treats DENY rules as exceptions to the ALLOW rules. For example:
;
;       [ORDER(ALLOW,DENY),ALLOW(*.*.*.*),DENY(192.168.*.*)]
;
;       would permit all addresses except those in the 192.168.0.0/16 range. However,
;
;       [ORDER(DENY,ALLOW),ALLOW(192.168.*.*),DENY(*.*.*.*)]
;
;       would deny all addresses except those in the 192.168.0.0/16 range.
;
;       If the ORDER tag is omitted, the default evaluation behavior is DENY,ALLOW
;
;   ALLOW and DENY:
;
;       A comma-separated list of one or more address masks that are used to filter
;       evaluation of the configuration data. If the client address passes the filter
;       evaluation, access to the configuration entry is permitted.  "Mask" may be either
;       an explicit IP address, a hostname, a mask value that uses '*' characters to
;       indicate wildcard octals, or a CIDR mask that uses a '/' character to specify a
;       routing prefix. Note that if a client hostname is used, that hostname must be
;       resolveable by the gateway.
;
;   Examples:
;
;       Ip Address:     [ORDER(ALLOW,DENY),ALLOW(*.*.*.*),DENY(192.168.1.10)]           Deny a specific IP
;       Hostname:       [ORDER(ALLOW,DENY),ALLOW(*.*.*.*),DENY(Host1)]                  Deny a specific Hostname
;       Wildcard:       [ORDER(ALLOW,DENY),ALLOW(*.*.*.*),DENY(192.168.*.*)]            Deny any address in the 192.168 subnet
;       CIDR Mask:      [ORDER(ALLOW,DENY),ALLOW(*.*.*.*),DENY(192.168.0.0/16)]         Deny any address with a 192.168 prefix (Equvalent to the above wildcard)

;
; Lifetime (in seconds) for credentials used to impersonate another user.
; A value of zero indicates that the token never expires.
;
DelegatedLoginTokenTimeout=36000

;
; Default lifetime (in seconds) for client-side cached login credentials, used to
; silently re-authenticate a client to the Integration Server in the event of a
; network disconnect. When using ProjectWise authentication, after this timeout
; occurs clients will be required to re-input their ProjectWise login credentials.
; A value of 0 (or less) is illegal. Use the "User Credential Expiration Policy"
; General user settings (in the ProjectWise Administrator) to set the policy for

;
; Uncomment this setting to configure this server as a ProjectWise Caching server.

;
; Name and ip address to use when advertising server. When running in a clustered

;
; Extraction processes usually hang on to filesystem access tokens after their default
; expiration (see "FileAccessTokenLifetime", above). If you are running extraction,
; specify the hosts that the extraction processes will be running on so that those
; 'trusted' servers have an extended file access token window.
;

;Comma separated list of databases, which are defined below.
Databases=db0

;
; List of Windows users/groups that are permitted to make remote configuration
; changes to this file (typically via the ProjectWise Administrator application).
; Users that will be creating, deleting or changing basic datasource properties
; (like ODBC settings, datasource name, etc) are required to either be explicitly
; listed here, or to belong to a group that is listed here. Note that this level of
; access is not required to perform "normal" ProjectWise administrative tasks (like
; adding users, setting up USS, storage areas, etc).
;
; NOTE: The Microsoft API that checks group membership is *extremely* picky about
; the formatting and case of the values in this list. You are advised to do a
; "whoami /groups" when obtaining group names to insert into this list, and to
; copy and paste the group text verbatim.
;
; Example: Local machine admins and members of the "DOMAIN\PW Power Users" group are permitted.
; CADOperators=Administrators;DOMAIN\PW Power Users

; By default, local administrators only
CADOperators=Administrators
ConnectionSrv=1

;
; By default, the service will log an informative message to the Windows event
; log every time the server license is renewed. This can result in a large
; number of entries in the event log. Set this value to 0 to disable these
; informative messages. Any licensing warnings or errors will still be
; unconditionally logged to the event log. This setting does not affect or
; control the recording of product usages to the license log.
;
;LogLicenseToWindowsEventLog=1

;
; By default, when the session is closed on server, all documents that were in the middle of
; Check Out / Check In operation are restored to their prior state ("Checked In" or "Checked Out").
; This is useful in situations where Check Out/Check In operation is interrupted by network issues
; or client application crash. In that case, document status is restored to "Checked In" or
; "Checked Out" instead of being left in "Going Out" or "Coming In" state.
; However, in some cases this feature can cause documents to be restored to their original state
; before file transfer is finished. In that case, Check Out operation may fail with error
; "Document is not checked in."
; Set this value to "false" to disable restoring of document status when server session is closed.
; In particular, this value must be set to "false" in servers running on Amazon ELB environments.
;
; ReleasePendingDocuments=true

;
; Time (in seconds) for the time skew window value.
;
; In situations where other services are working cooperatively with the ProjectWise server (e.g.,
; Transmittals) it is essential that the system clocks on the various computers be synchronized
; to ensure data integrity.  In some cases, this is not possible (no time server available, servers
; are in different locations, etc). The following setting can be used to set a "window" to allow
; for this time skew.  This setting should only be used after consulting with Bentley technical support.
;
; The maximum value for this setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes). Positive integer values only.

;EventLogging=EventLoggingATP.dll
;drmsvcsrv=drmsvcsrv.dll

[ServerNameResolution]
; -----------------------------------------------------------
; This section provides additional name resolution information to the integration server itself.
; This section can be useful when dealing with NAT configurations, where the internal
; integration server is advertised externally using an IP address that is not resolvable
; internally.
; -----------------------------------------------------------

;Format
;IP Address = Host Name

;Examples
;10.10.10.3 = Server1
;10.10.10.4 = Server2


[NameResolution]
; -----------------------------------------------------------
; This section provides additional name resolution information to PW Explorer clients
;
; An Access Control List (ACL) may be applied to these entries, to
; allow and/or deny access to individual or entire subnets of IP addresses. See the
; discussion of ACL attributes at the top of this file for more information.
; -----------------------------------------------------------

;Format
;IP Address = Host Name

;Examples
;10.10.10.1 = Server1
;10.10.10.2 = Server2

[Gateway]
; This section provides ProjectWise client applications information about where to direct
; client network requests when a route is configured. This section does _NOT_ define the
; route itself; it merely provides information to the clients as to which machine is the first
; hop in the route. Note that the machine this file is installed on does not necessarily need
; to be the gateway; this section can simply provide information to the clients as to which
; machine the gateway is). This information is sent directly to the ProjectWise client, so it
; is critical that the Gateway Server hostname be a hostname that the client machine can route
; to, for example the external host name configured in a NAT server.
;
; Once the gateway information is provided to the client, all client DMS communications will be
; directed to the Gateway server rather than the actual endpoint server.
;
; Note that the server that is acting as the gateway also needs to have the [routing]
; section of this file properly configured to forward the request to the proper upstream
; server (see [routing], below).
;
; An Access Control List (ACL) may be applied to these entries, to
; allow and/or deny access to individual or entire subnets of IP addresses. See the
; discussion of ACL attributes at the top of this file for more information.
;
; NOTE: if you have disabled UDP discovery on the client machines, you must register
; _this_ machine in both the DNS and Datasource Listing tabs of the ProjectWise Network
; Control Panel Applet.
;
; Examples:
;
; For the configuration client -> gateway1 -> endpoint, where the gateway for the clients
; is 'gateway1' and 'endpoint' is the server that will ultimately handle the client request:
;
; endpoint = gateway1
;
; For the configuration client -> gateway1 -> gateway2 -> endpoint, where the gateway
; for the clients is 'gateway1' and 'endpoint' is the server that will ultimately handle the
; client request, the syntax is exactly the same. We are simply telling the client where to
; send the request to first.
;
; endpoint = gateway1
;
; For the configuration client -> gateway1 -> endpoint, where the gateway for the clients
; is 'gateway1' and 'endpoint' is the server that will ultimately handle the client request,
; and the gateway is only visible to clients on the 192.168.17.* and 192.168.21.* subnets:
;
; endpoint = gateway1[allow(192.168.17.*,192.168.21.*),deny(*.*.*.*)]
;

; -----------------------------------------------------------
; Section provides routing configuration to this server
; -----------------------------------------------------------

[ServerGateway]
; This section provides ProjectWise Integration/Caching servers information about how to route
; requests to other servers. This section does _NOT_ define the route itself; it merely
; provides information to the server as to which machine is the first hop in the route.
; This section should be used on Integration/Caching servers that are not directly connected
; and must traverse a ProjectWise Gateway to communicate. The first hop gateway must be
; resolvable/reachable by this server. Name resolution for server gateways is done using
; normal lookups, not the dmskrnl resolution sections.
;
; If a server route is defined, all communication to that server will be routed through
; the configured Gateway server rather than the actual endpoint server.
;
; Examples:
;
; For the configuration IntegrationSrv -> gateway1 -> CachingServer, where IntegrationSrv
; and CachingServer can't directly communicate:
; CachingServer = gateway1
;

[Routing]
; This section is used by the server that this config file is installed on to determine
; how to forward requests to the upstream endpoint server (the server we are a gateway for).
; There are two variations on the syntax; if additional ProjectWise network nodes must traversed
; in order to reach the upstream server, the first syntax must be used. If the upstream server is
; adjacent to the gateway (in terms of the network topology), then the second syntax must be used.
;
; Configuration entry syntax is:
;     endpoint = <DMS port number for next hop>,<server name of next hop>
; or:
;     endpoint = <DMS port number for next hop>
;
; For the configuration: client -> gateway1 -> gateway2 -> endpoint, where this machine is 'gateway1'
; and 'gateway2' is listening on TCP port 5800:
;
; endpoint = 5800,gateway2
;
; For the configuration: client -> gateway1 -> endpoint, where this machine is 'gateway1', and 'endpoint'
; is listening on TCP port 5800:
;
; endpoint = 5800

;servers = myHostName, 192.168.99.23, myHost2

; Path to the root of the cache
;storagepath = c:\cache

; Limit for cached files, in megabytes. When the total size of all cached files exceeds this limit,
; the cache is purged (in ascending access time order) until the total size of all cached files
; is <= 80% of this limit. For extremely large caches, or caches with many small files, it may take
; several purge passes to get below the limit.
; If this setting is not defined, or is set to 0, then purging is disabled, and the cache size is
; effectively unlimited. To prevent the disk from filling up, it may be necessary to implement a
; custom purge process.
;limit=xxx

; max # of files purged per pass, default 1000
;purgebatchsize=1000

; use hostnames in the cache file path instead of IP addresses, default false.
;UseHostnameInPath = 1|0

; Example 2
; enabled = true
; storagepath = c:\cache
; servers = host1, host2, 192.168.99.34
; UseHostnameInPath = 1     ; cache path will be c:\cache\files\host1-5800\, rather than c:\cache\files\172.55.43.10-5800\

[FileTokenPublicKeys]
; This section is used by the Caching server to statically configure Integration Server
; encryption keys. These keys are use to validate file transfer requests. By default,
; the Caching Server will attempt to dynamically request the key from the Integration Server.
; However, in some cases network configuration may prevent this dynamic request. You can
; find the public key value for an Integration Server in the Encryption tab of the
; ProjectWise Administrator Server properties.
;
; Examples:
;
; If this server is a file storage server for the Integration server Int1:
; Int1 = Public_key_goes_here

; -----------------------------------------------------------
; Section provides services configuration
; -----------------------------------------------------------

[DmsServices]
; This section is used by the Gateway server that this config file is installed on
; to setup the port number of routed server if the default port number was not used.  The port
; number is also used by Integration Server to connect to Caching Server providing file storage.

;Format
;server1=port number

;Examples
;server1=5801

; See the Bentley i-model Composition Server product documentation
; for more information.
;
; An Access Control List (ACL) may be applied to these entries,
; to allow and/or deny access to individual or entire subnets of IP addresses.
; See the discussion of ACL attributes at the top of this file for more information.
;
; If more than one web service endpoint is defined for any given IP address,
; the first one is used.  If that web service is unresponsive, the remaining
; endpoints are attempted in the order in which they are defined.

;Format
;<unique_name> = <endpoint> [ALLOW(ip_address1,ip_address2,...),DENY(ip_address3,ip_address4,...)]

;Examples
;restricted = http://restricted.example.com/RenditionService/RenditionService.svc [ALLOW(193.25.4.*),DENY(10.*.*.*,193.25.*.*)]
;everyone = https://everyone.example.com:443/RenditionService/RenditionService.svc

; Section provides Dynamic Rights Management configuration
; --------------------------------------------------------

[DynamicRightsManagement]
;
; This section is used to define settings that are used by the Dynamic Rights Management
; service (DRM).
;

;
; DrmEndpoint
;
; DrmEndpoint defines the endpoint address of the DRM web service that processes Dynamic
; Rights requests from client nodes.
;
;Format
;DrmEndpoint = <endpoint>
;
;Example
;DrmEndpoint = net.tcp://<machinename>:808/BentleyDRMService/service.svc/tcp


;
; DrmGroup
; 
; DrmGroup specifies the name of the ProjectWise group that is allowed to access Dynamic Rights
; commands from client nodes. If DrmGroup is not defined all users have access to the Dynamic
; Rights commands 
;
;Format
;DrmGroup = <group_name>
;
;Example
;DrmGroup = Administrator

; Example datasource configurations
; -----------------------------------------------------------

;To set Single Sign-on (SSO) on/off for a datasource (SSO is off by default):
;[db0]
;SSO=1
;turns SSO on, and
;SSO=0
;will turn SSO off.

; Example configuration for a ProjectWise Gateway Server that dynamically
; advertises datasources.

;[db0]
;DsServer=1
;server=<Integration Server name>

; If ProjectWise Integration Server is installed outside the local network,
; for example on a Cloud virtual machine, it cannot access the local domain
; controller and authenticate Windows users. In that case, User Synchronization
; Service can be installed on a local network (LAN) to provide delegated logins
; and allow synchronized Windows users to access ProjectWise Integration Server.
; To enable User Synchronization Service delegated logins, the UserSyncService
; option below must be set to the name of the local machine on which User
; Synchronization Service is installed. Also, the IP address of the User
; Synchronization Service machine must be added to the [Trusted Servers] list in this file.
;[db0]
;UserSyncService=<User Synchronization Service host name>

;
; Example configuration for a ProjectWise Gateway Server that advertises
; a distinct datasource.
; Note: You must specify SSO=1 on the gateway if you want to enable SSO for
; a distinct datasource. SSO=1 is not required for dynamic datasources.
;
;[db{x}]
;Description=<"Real" Datasource name on the Integration Server>
;DisplayName=<Optional display name you want the clients to see>
;Server=<Integration Server address or name>

;
; Example configuration for a ProjectWise Integration Server
;
;[db{x}]
;Description=<"Real" Datasource name>
;Name=<ODBC data source name>
;InterfaceType=ODBC (always)
;Type=<Database type Microsoft SQL Server|Oracle>
;DBUserName=<DB username>
;DBUserPassword=<DB password>
;DBUsrPwdDecrypt=<crypt type (set by server, enter 0 to reencrypt a plaintext password)>
;DisableAuditTruncation=1 (optional, use to disable audit trail truncation in a load-balanced configuration)
